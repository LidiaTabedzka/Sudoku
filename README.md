# Sudoku
Task within Kodilla bootcamp. The aim was to create a Sudoku Game App.

The app uses sudoku-umd library and React.

It is a game where you have to fill all the missing fields with a number from 1 to 9, but each row, each column and each 3x3 box can contain the same number only once.

You can:

- choose the game level,

- restart the game from beginning,

- check if your inputs are correct,

- check the solution if you give up,

- undo your moves.
